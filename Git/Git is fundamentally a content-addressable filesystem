Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.

In the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized this filesystem rather than a polished VCS. In the last few years, the UI has been refined until itâ€™s as clean and easy to use as any system out there; however, the stereotype lingers about the early Git UI that was complex and difficult to learn.

After a rebase, you have to force push, otherwise the push won't be accepted. HOWEVER, instead of performing a conventional force push (`git push --force`), you SHOULD ALWAYS perform a force push with lease (`git push --force-with-lease`). This option checks for changes on the remote branch and issues you a warning if there are any (e.g, another developer has pushed to master while you are performing a rebase), so that you can make sure that you are not squashing that commit (that is, you can make sure that including that commit) in the rebase. There doesn't seem to be any reason to use `--force` over `--force-with-lease` any time. That is, you SHOULD ALWAYS use `--force-with-lease`, instead of only `--force`.
